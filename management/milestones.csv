DeriveManagementPlan,nil,2,yhl15,        this   ,Derive rough plan of project and complete milestones.csv and schedule.csv,
BasicCLexer,             LexingLab,3,vgr16,dc5e78739a4ef1346f6064c36f1c402d08e2bafb,Consider structure of C lexer and begin lexing simple C code I.e int main return 0 and most basic data types and keywords,
BasicCParser,BasicCLexer,6,yhl15,d8d5394c135d452407548aa8544416fc369775bc,Take Lexed Tokens as input directly through to the end of Parsing and produce an AST and print this AST,
Script_Tests_Lexer_parser,BasicCParser,2,vgr16,dba5f4b9dcf3f3e01ea7bda8cd3e20c8dc34c30f,Write script for testbench to automate tests to allow more expressions of code to be parsed accurately without destroying whats working,
Grammar_Hierarchy,BasicCParser,8,vgr16,388af8f99ff563efcc877570bcfbb71e5a67ad5e,"Consider and implement a neater and more accurate grammar hierarchy, expand it with more test cases to verify",
Expand_Lexicals_Grammar,Grammar_Hierarchy,8,yhl15,,"Use somewhat well designed hierarchy to introduce more tokens and parse them correctly,",
NearCompletedCParser,Expand_Lexicals_Grammar,8,vgr16,,Have our parser Parse almost all the statements thats valid in c89 and compiling it against actual c code,
CtoPythonParser,NearCompletedCparser,8,yhl15,,Use Existing Lexer and parser to convert AST to python code,
TestCtoPythonParser,CtoPythonParser,6,vgr16,,Test C to python Parser and run it against testbench,
PlanCodeGenStructure,CodeGenLab,6,yhl15,,Plan Structure for Code Gen from AST to Mips Asm and have basic design layout,
StartCodeGen,PlanCodeGenStructure,8,vgr16,,Have codegen working for 30% of functionality,
DecentCodegen,StartCodeGen,8,yhl15,,Have codegen working for 50% of functionality,
WellWorkingCodegen,DecentCodegen,8,vgr16,,Codegen should work for 80% of functionality to be implemented,
Testsuiteforcomplier,StartCodeGen,8,yhl15,,Implement structure for testsuite and test the codegen with it simultaneously while developing codegen,
TestsuiteandCodegen,Testsuiteforcompiler,8,vgr16,,,Develop Codegen and testsuite hand in hand to attain maximum functionality of our compiler
TieLooseEnds,TestsuiteandCodegen,3,vgr16,,Tie up loose ends and edge cases if any,
