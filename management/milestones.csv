DeriveManagementPlan,nil,2,yhl15,        this   ,Derive rough plan of project and complete milestones.csv and schedule.csv,
BasicCLexer,             LexingLab,3,vgr16,dc5e78739a4ef1346f6064c36f1c402d08e2bafb,Consider structure of C lexer and begin lexing simple C code I.e int main return 0 and most basic data types and keywords,
BasicCParser,BasicCLexer,6,yhl15,d8d5394c135d452407548aa8544416fc369775bc,Take Lexed Tokens as input directly through to the end of Parsing and produce an AST and print this AST,
Script_Tests_Lexer_parser,BasicCParser,2,vgr16,dba5f4b9dcf3f3e01ea7bda8cd3e20c8dc34c30f,Write script for testbench to automate tests to allow more expressions of code to be parsed accurately without destroying whats working,
Grammar_Hierarchy,BasicCParser,8,vgr16,388af8f99ff563efcc877570bcfbb71e5a67ad5e,"Consider and implement a neater and more accurate grammar hierarchy, expand it with more test cases to verify",
Expand_Lexicals_Grammar,Grammar_Hierarchy,8,yhl15,92f829f389913afc42a345f699dbfc7607fa7d21,"Use somewhat well designed hierarchy to introduce more tokens and parse them correctly,",
DecentPythonTranslator,Expand_Lexicals_Grammar,7,yhl15,beac046e4e3686e6ef6bb23371a4eec38734d66f,"Go through AST from parsing stage to translate from to python, have it work for 80%",
TestCtoPythonTranslator,DecentPythonTranslator,6,vgr16,beac046e4e3686e6ef6bb23371a4eec38734d66f,Develop testbench and generate tests as we aim to translate 100% of the subset of C defined in specifications,
CtoPythonTranslator,TestCtoPythonTranslator,3,yhl15,,Translate 100% of the subset of C provided and verify with testcases completed,
PlanCodeGenStructure,CodeGenLab,4,yhl15,,Plan Structure for Code Gen from AST to Mips Asm and have basic design layout,
StartCodeGen,PlanCodeGenStructure,8,vgr16,,Have codegen working for 30% of functionality,
NearCompletedCParser,StartCodeGen,8,vgr16,,Have our parser Parse almost all the statements thats valid in c89 and compiling it against actual c code,
DecentCodegen,NearCompletedCParser,8,yhl15,,Have codegen working for 50% of functionality,
WellWorkingCodegen,DecentCodegen,8,vgr16,,Codegen should work for 80% of functionality to be implemented,
Testsuiteforcomplier,StartCodeGen,8,yhl15,,Implement structure for testsuite and test the codegen with it simultaneously while developing codegen,
FinishCodegen,WellWorkingCodegen,8,vgr16,,Complete codegen for mips asm as well as have a good testbench for it,
TieLooseEnds,FinishCodegen,3,vgr16,,Tie up loose ends and edge cases if any,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,Develop Codegen and testsuite hand in hand to attain maximum functionality of our compiler
